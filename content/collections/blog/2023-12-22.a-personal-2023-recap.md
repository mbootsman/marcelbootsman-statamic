In this case, I just wanted to explore other possibilities, and since Kinsta is embracing other frameworks and CMSes it seemed like a good exercise to learn about other technologies besides WordPress. Also, a simple blog, can be a good fit to be hosted as a static site, for performance and security reasons I will not further dive into here.'
