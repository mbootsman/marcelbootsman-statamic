She had seen me grow up, seen me struggle, supported me through phases of frustration, restlessness, and endless overthinking all without a clear explanation for why things always felt a little harder, more intense, more “off” than they seemed to be for others. Having her there that day meant a lot.'

            text: 'The entire day was a combination of tests, conversations and observations. At times it felt clinical, other times incredibly personal. I talked about my past, my focus (or lack of that), my energy levels, my patterns, and the ways I had learned to adapt, mask, and push through. Some questions hit harder than expected. Others brought unexpected relief, as if someone finally understood what had been going on inside my head for years.'

            text: 'After the official diagnose came the moment I tried ADHD medication for the first time. I had mixed feelings. Hopeful, skeptical, a bit nervous. But within an hour or so, something subtle started to shift. The chaos in my mind quieted just enough for me to hear myself think. I didn’t feel drugged or different, just more focused. More in control. I could follow a thought without losing it halfway and I could sit still for twenty minutes during the QbTest. '

It was absolutely amazing to experience another version of myself. I can honestly say Marcel version 1.1 is in beta!'

One where I can stop guessing and start understanding myself better. Where I can stop compensating for something unnamed, and begin navigating life with more awareness and more tools, both internal and external.'

The road ahead is still full of discovery, but for the first time in a long time, it feels like I’m walking it with a map.'
