            text: 'This weekend was a weekend of freedom. Freedom to have scheduled appointments. Freedom to do what we like, when we like it. So we went on a tiny little trip, rented a rowing-boat and got away. Just the four of us. My wife, our son, our daughter and me. We brought sandwiches, drinks and had little picknick in the boat. We anchored the boat on a location where no other people where and climbed out of it. We ‘landed’ in a freshly mowed stretch of grass, ran down the hill an had fun for just a few minutes. Our son decided to walk up again and right at that moment is saw this picture in my head. So I grabbed my phone and took the picture. This picture really captures how we all felt yesterday. Free.'
