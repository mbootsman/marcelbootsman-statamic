After co-organizing the first WCEU in Leiden in 2013, I skipped Sofia, attended Seville with my wife, skipped Vienna in 2016, and now we’re back. On our way to Paris. The first time for me as attendee, and not as co-organizer. Let me tell you why.'

Besides getting customers and sending invoices ;-). I had to make a decision between helping organize an AWESOME event, or serve those new clients who were waiting for me to agree to do business with them. I chose the latter.'
