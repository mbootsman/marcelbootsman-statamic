            text: 'One of the primary reasons I turned away from big tech social media is the alarming disregard for user privacy exhibited by many of these platforms. WhatsApp, once cheered upon for its end-to-end encryption, faced a backlash when it announced plans to share user data with its parent company, Facebook. This raised serious questions about the sanctity of private conversations and the potential misuse of personal information.'

            text: 'Signal, on the other hand, is renowned for its commitment to privacy. It offers robust end-to-end encryption for all messages and calls, ensuring that no one but the intended recipient can access your communication. This dedication to privacy aligns with my values and gives me peace of mind in a digital world where privacy is increasingly threatened. For these reasons I have decided to pay a monthly donation to the Signal foundation to keep the project going.'

            text: 'Another concern with big tech platforms is the ownership and control of user-generated content and data. Instagram and Twitter, for instance, have the power to suspend or delete accounts without clear explanations or avenues for recourse. Users have little control over their content, and the platforms often monetize user data without providing adequate compensation or transparency.'

            text: "Mastodon, a decentralized social network, stands in stark contrast. It operates on open-source software (if you don’t know it yet, I’m a big fan of OSS) and empowers users to host their own instances, giving them full control over their content and the communities they build. This decentralization fosters a sense of ownership and accountability that's IMHO sorely lacking in big tech alternatives."

This often results in echo chambers and a toxic online environment. As someone who values thoughtful discussion and genuine connections, this turned into a major turn-off, especially for Twitter. I was active on Twitter since 2009, and I’ve really seen it evolve to a toxic place.'

It was driven by concerns about privacy, data ownership, the quality of online interactions, and ethical considerations. While these alternatives may not have the user base of their big tech counterparts, they offer a more secure, private, and community-oriented online experience. It's a step towards reclaiming control over our digital lives and fostering healthier online communities."
