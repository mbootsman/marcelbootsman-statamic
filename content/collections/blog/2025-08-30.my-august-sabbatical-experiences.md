            text: 'Some moments in life give you the opportunity to pause, reset, and gain new perspective. For me, August was one of those moments. I took (or should I say received the possibility to take) a sabbatical month, and looking back, I feel grateful, recharged, and surprisingly inspired by the experience.'

I booked a family holiday for the first two weeks, then a father/son holiday for a week, and for the final week a week for myself in a cabin in Zeeland, The Netherlands.'
