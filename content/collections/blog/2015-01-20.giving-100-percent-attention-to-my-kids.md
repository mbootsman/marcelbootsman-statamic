            text: 'Self-employed business owners are busy, very busy. Being productive, checking and responding to email and social media and keeping in contact with your clients and your network. Just a few things self-employed business owners need to take care of every day. But what if all that work is standing in the way of a great day with your kids?'

Well, daddy was buried in his phone reading email and his twitter timeline. This moment, just a few days ago, helped me to decide what I did today. Use my phone only to answer calls from my wife, family, friends and other non-business callers and focus on my kids. OK, and to check the weather when I need to go out with the kids and the dog.'

            text: 'I’m not going to write a long story about what methods there are to focus and leave your business out of sight for just one day. It’s very simple to be honest. If you feel distracted from your children, determine what the distraction is and eliminate it. Stop! Don’t fold your iPad in two or dump your Nexus 6 in the toilet. Just turn notifications off. No sound, no flashing light and no notification in the notification area. That’s where it starts. This way you have to initiate the need for information, and that’s the exact moment you can say to yourself: No, not today! That summarizes the method. There’s nothing more to it. Just do it (Sorry Nike, it is/was a great slogan).'

            text: 'Attention. Just look at that word. Yeah, focus on attention. It pays back, being there for your kids, not just physically, pays back right away. Conversations between the kids and me are more relaxed, I answer immediately when they ask something, I see what happens as it happens, I can help when needed, etc. etc. All positive things that pay back by means of your kids enjoying your presence. That should be enough right?'
